# Image-Classification-of-Shark-Tank-Cast

### What will I do?
Given images of Shark tank Cast I will tell the name of person based on images

### Tools:
1. Python Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn
2. Open CV 

### Dataset:
My dataset consists of 5 different Shark Tank image judges and I have downloaded the data from Google using Fatkun Chrome extension which is used to batch download the image from the current tab. 

So, I have 5 folders which consist of images five Shark Tank judges named:
1. Mark Cuban
2. Lori Greiner
3. Kevin O'Leary
4. Barbara Corcoran
5. Robert Herjavec

### Data Cleaning is done and now we will build our model.
We will use Grid Search to try out different models with different parameters. Goal is to come up with best model with best fine-tuned parameters.

### Conclusion:
I received more accuracy using hyper parameters:
1. Logistic Regression: 87.73%
2. SVM: 87.73
